# Bootstrap 5 Project

## Project Summary
This project consists of three responsive web pages (`index.html`, `about.html`, `contact.html`) built using Bootstrap 5.  
The goal was to remix official Bootstrap components like navbars, cards, hero/carousel sections, and forms to create clean and modern layouts.

## Tools Used
- HTML5, CSS3
- Bootstrap 5 (via CDN)
- GitHub (for version control & hosting)
- GitHub Pages (for live deployment)

## Step-by-Step Process
1. Created `index.html`, `about.html`, `contact.html` with a consistent navbar and footer.
2. Added a hero carousel on the homepage.
3. Used cards to showcase features/services on the homepage and about page.
4. Built a contact page with a working form.
5. Applied minor custom CSS for spacing, colors, and card shadows.
6. Uploaded all files to GitHub via web interface.
7. Deployed the site using GitHub Pages.

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Git not installed**: solved by uploading files directly via GitHub web interface.
- **Responsive design**: tested and fixed stacking issues using Bootstrap grid and utility classes.
- **Image paths**: ensured `assets/` folder structure matched file references to prevent broken images.

## AI / External Help
- Used Bootstrap official documentation and examples for component structure.
- Minimal adaptation to create original layouts.
- No AI-generated code was used for the HTML; this was written manually based on Bootstrap examples.

## Learning Outcome
- Hands-on experience with Bootstrap 5 components and utilities.
- Learned how to remix and compose UI elements into original responsive pages.
- Gained practical knowledge of deploying static sites via GitHub Pages.

## Total Time Taken
Approximately 1 hour.
